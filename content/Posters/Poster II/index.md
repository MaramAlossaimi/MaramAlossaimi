## Abstrac

The concept of Poisson algebras is one of the most important concepts in mathematics that make a link between commutative and non-commutative algebra. 

Poisson algebras can be defined as Lie algebras that satisfy the Leibniz rule. Our research is about classifying a large Poisson algebra class $A = K[t][x,y]$,

that is a Poisson polynomial algebra in two variables $x$ and y with coefficients on the Poisson polynomial algebra $K[t]$, where $K$ is an algebraic closure field 

with zero characteristic. There are three main cases of the classification of the Poisson algebra class $A$. I am interested in the Poisson spectrum of $A$, 

minimal and maximal Poisson ideals of $A$. I present the first case of the classification in the poster called "Poisson Algebras I" and in this poster, 

I  present a part of the second case of the classification and its Poisson spectrum.
