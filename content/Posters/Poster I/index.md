### Abstrac

A large class of Poisson algebras $A$ is a polynomial Poisson algebra in two variables $x$ and $y$ with coefficients 
in a polynomial Poisson algebra in one variable $t$. I classified class $A$, over an algebraic closure field $K$ with zero
characteristic, by using Lemma (Oh, 2006). I concluded that there are three main cases, and each case has several subcases.
Then I have found the Poisson spectrum of $A$ in each case. In this poster, I identify only the first case.


### Event 
I participated by presenting my poster in several conferences and workshops as an example

1. The British Mathematical Colloquium (BMC) and the British Applied Mathematics Colloquium (BAMC), 6 to 9 April 2021.
2. The Young Researchers in Mathematics conference, from 7 to 9 June 2021.
3. The LMS Women in Mathematics Day, 16 June 2021.
