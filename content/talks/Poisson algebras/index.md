title: The Poisson Algebras talk

event:  the LMS Graduate Student Meeting 
event_url: 




summary: I gave a virtua short talk at the LMS Graduate Student Meeting, 8 November 2021.
abstract: "The concept of Poisson algebra is one of the most important concepts in mathematics that make a link between commutative and noncommutative algebra. The Poisson algebra D can be defined as an algebra over a field K with Poisson bracket {,} such that (D,{,}) is satisfying anti-commutative, Jacobi identity and Leibniz rule. In this talk, I will give the definition of Poisson algebra, talk about some related concepts of polynomial Poisson algebras and give some examples."

### Abstract:
The concept of Poisson algebras is one of the most important concepts in mathematics that make a link between commutative and non-commutative algebra. 
Poisson algebras can be defined as Lie algebras that satisfy the Leibniz rule. Our research is about classifying a large Poisson algebra class $A = K[t][x,y]$, 
that is a Poisson polynomial algebra in two variables $x$ and $y$ with coefficients on the Poisson polynomial algebra $K[t]$, where $K$ is an algebraic closure field 
with zero characteristic. There are three main cases of the Poisson algebra class $A$ and each case has several subcases. We are interested in the Poisson spectrum 
of $A$, minimal and maximal Poisson ideals of $A$.
