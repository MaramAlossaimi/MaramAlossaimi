title:  Introduction in Generalized Weyl Poisson Algebras Talk

event:  The 8th International Congress on Fundamental and Applied Sciences
event_url: http://icfas2021.intsa.org/index.html

location: Antalya, Turkey


summary: I gave a virtua short talk at the $8^{th}$ International Congress on Fundamental and Applied Sciences, Antalya, Turkey, 19-21 October 2021.
abstract: "The concept of Poisson algebra is one of the most important concepts in mathematics that make a link between commutative and noncommutative algebra. The Poisson algebra D can be defined as an algebra over a field K with Poisson bracket {,} such that (D,{,}) is satisfying anti-commutative, Jacobi identity and Leibniz rule. In this talk, I will give the definition of Poisson algebra, talk about some related concepts of polynomial Poisson algebras and give some examples."

### Abstract:
The Generalized Weyl Poisson algebra $A=$[$X,Y;a,\partial$} can be defined as a $K$-algebra generated by a basic Poisson algebra $D$ over a field $K$, 
$2n$ indeterminates $X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n,$ $Y_1,Y_2,\ldots,Y_n,$ $\partial=(\partial_1,\partial_2, \ldots, \partial_n)$  which is an  $n$-tuple commuting
Poisson derivations on $D$ and $a=(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n)$ which is  an $n$-tuple elements in the Poisson centre of $D$ with subject to specific relations. 
In this talk, I give the definition of the generalized Weyl Poisson algebra, I talk about the existence, and I give some definitions and examples 
related to generalized Weyl Poisson algebras.
