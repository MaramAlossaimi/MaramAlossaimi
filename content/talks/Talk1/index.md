title: Polynomial Poisson Algebras talk
abstract: The concept of Poisson algebra is one of the most important concepts in math- ematics that make a link between commutative and noncommutative algebra. The Poisson algebra D can be defined as an algebra over a field K with Poisson bracket {,} such that (D,{,}) is satisfying anti-commutative, Jacobi identity and Leibniz rule. In this talk, I will give the definition of Poisson algebra, talk about some related concepts of polynomial Poisson algebras and give some examples.
