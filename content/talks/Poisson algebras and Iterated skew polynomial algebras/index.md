summary: I gave a virtua short talk at the First International Conference on Mathematics and Computation, Rajkiya Engineering College Kannauj, India, 22-23 October 2021.
abstract: The concept of Poisson algebra is one of the most important concepts in mathematics that make a link between commutative and noncommutative algebra. The Poisson algebra D can be defined as an algebra over a field K with Poisson bracket {,} such that (D,{,}) is satisfying anti-commutative, Jacobi identity and Leibniz rule. In this talk, I will give the definition of Poisson algebra, talk about some related concepts of polynomial Poisson algebras and give some examples.

### Abstract:
 Let $B$ be a Poisson algebra $\C[x,y,z]$ with Poisson bracket ${y,x}=c_1 xy+\rho_1,$
 ${z,x}=c_2 xz+\rho_2,$   ${z,y}=c_3 xy+\rho_3$, where  $c_i, \rho_i \in \C$  and $i=1,2,3$. 
 We can obtain an iterated skew polynomial algebra such that its semiclassical limit is equal to $B$. 
 In this talk I will give some definitions, theorems and examples.
