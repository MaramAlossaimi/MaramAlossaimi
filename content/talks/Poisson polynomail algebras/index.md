title:  Polynomial Poisson Algebras Talk

event: The $10^{th}$ International Eurasian Conference on Mathematical Sciences and applications
event_url: http://www.iecmsa.org



summary: I gave a virtua short talk at the $10^{th}$ International Eurasian Conference on Mathematical Sciences and applications, Sakarya, Turkey, 25 - 27 August 2021.
abstract: The concept of Poisson algebra is one of the most important concepts in mathematics that make a link between commutative and noncommutative algebra. The Poisson algebra D can be defined as an algebra over a field K with Poisson bracket {,} such that (D,{,}) is satisfying anti-commutative, Jacobi identity and Leibniz rule. In this talk, I will give the definition of Poisson algebra, talk about some related concepts of polynomial Poisson algebras and give some examples.

### Abstract:
 The concept of Poisson algebra is one of the most important concepts in mathematics that make a link between commutative and noncommutative algebra. The Poisson algebra 
 $D$ can be defined as an algebra over a field $K$ with Poisson bracket {$\cdot, \cdot$} such that ($D,$ {$\cdot, \cdot$}) is satisfying anticommutative, Jacobi identity 
 and Leibniz rule. In this talk, I give the definition of Poisson algebra, talk about some related concepts of polynomial Poisson algebras and give some examples.
