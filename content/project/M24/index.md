The Mathieu groups are $M_{11}, M_{12}, M_{22}, M_{23}$ and $M_{24}$, which are one family of the $26$ sporadic finite simple groups.
They were discovered by the French math- ematician Emile Mathieu. Furthermore, the first expression  of simplicity and uniqueness of Mathieu groups was 
in 1930â€™s in a paper by Witt, and a Steiner system was describled in this project. Now, we are normally using the system to describe these groups. 
The largest Mathieu group is $M_{24}$ which is $5$-transitive of $24$-point, and it could be defined as a group of preserved permutations of Steiner 
system $S(5, 8, 24)$. Notice that some of $M_{24}$'s simple subgroups are $M_{11}, M_{12}, M_{22},$ and  $M_{23}$. This project  start by introducing 
some basic facts, moving to the definition of Steiner system and some of its properties, followed by discussing the Steiner system $S(5, 8, 24)$, 
and then presenting  the Miracle Octad Generator (MOG). Then we will end by introducing the concept of $M_{24}$. Finally, the main two sources for this project are
(An introduction to Steiner systems by M. Grannell and T. Griggs) and (A new combinatorial approach to $M_{24}$ by R. Curtis).
