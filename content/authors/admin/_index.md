    My research is about classifying a special case of the Poisson algebra class $A = (K[t]; \alpha, \beta, c, u)$ that is a polynomial Poisson algebra in two variables $x$ and $y$ with cofficients in a polynomial Poisson algebra $K[t]$ 
    in one variable $t$. We classified class $A = K[t][x,y]$, over an algebraic closure field $K$ with zero characteristic. We concluded that there are three main cases and each subcase consists of several subcases. 
    We are interested in the Poisson spectra, maximal and minimal Poisson prime ideals for Poisson algebra A in each subcase. So, we classify all the Poisson prime ideals for these subcases to study properties of their Poisson enveloping 
    algebras and some of simple Poisson finite dimensional $A$-modules. We present the containment from Poisson prime ideals for each subcase in figures. This work has been done under the supervision of Prof. Vladimir Bavula.
