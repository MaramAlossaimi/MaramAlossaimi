I  am a lecturer in Mathematics and Statistics department, Science  college at the  [University of Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud](https://imamu.edu.sa/en/Pages/default.aspx) in  Saudi Arabia since 2014.  

I started my PhD journey in 2018,  under the supervision of  [Prof. Vladimir Bavula](https://maths.dept.shef.ac.uk/maths/staff_info_1.html).
Our research is about classifying a pecial case of the Poisson algebra class $A = (D;\alpha,\beta,c,u),$ [(Oh, 2006)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19Zh_mbET4isNuD18_yLcDfK8jxk4iIEk/view?usp=sharing). 
The case is the Poisson polynomial alg ra   two variables $x$ and $y$ with coefficients in the Poisson polynomial  algebra $K[t]$ in one variable $t$. We classified the large Poisson algebra class 
${\color{brown(web)}A=K[t][x,y]}$, over an algebraic closure field $K$ with zero characteristic. The classification  consists of three main cases and each subcase has several subcases. We are interested 
in the Poisson spectra, maximal and minimal Poisson prime ideals for each subcase of the Poisson algebra class $A$. Therefore, we classify all the Poisson prime ideals for these subcases in order to 
study some properties of their Poisson algebras, Poisson enveloping algebras and some simple finite dimensional Poisson  ${\color{brown(web)}A}$-modules. I  present the results, i.e. the containment of 
Poisson prime ideals for each subcase in diagrams. I presented this research in two posters (Poisson Algebras I) and (Poisson Algebras II).

After, I finish my PhDâ€™s degree I am going back to teach at the University of Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud.
